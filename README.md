# unicycle_race

Created with Java GUI, this project features a simulation of a unicycle road race with five unicycles of different sizes. 
It implements the composite pattern to treat the class Unicycle as a single graphical object, and the observer pattern to control Unicycles (or Peloton) and Persons (or Crowd).

## How to Play with the Simulation
**Note: Once the unicycles reach the finish line, the race ends!**

You can start the race by increasing the speed of the unicycles using a slider control.
Above the race track, a crowd of cheering spectators is animated to jump up and down with excitement.
The level of excitement of the crowd can also be adjusted using a separate slider control.
